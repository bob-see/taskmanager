✨ Core Concepts

Profiles

Each profile acts as an independent workspace with its own:
	•	tasks
	•	projects
	•	categories
	•	reporting context

This keeps different areas of life or work cleanly separated.

Projects

Projects group related tasks and provide progress tracking and reporting context.
Tasks can exist with or without a project.

Tasks

Tasks support:
	•	start dates (when work becomes active)
	•	optional due dates
	•	recurring schedules (daily, weekly, custom)
	•	categories
	•	project assignment
	•	completion tracking
	•	rollover behaviour

⸻

🚀 PR10 — Quick Add + Snooze/Reschedule (Day view)

Summary

PR10 makes the Day view much faster to use by introducing a Quick Add input for rapid task entry and Snooze/Reschedule controls (single task + bulk) to push work forward without editing each task manually.

This milestone focuses on speed and flow — getting tasks in and moving them around becomes a “type → enter → keep going” experience.

What’s Included

⚡ Quick Add (Day view)
A new Quick Add bar sits at the top of the Day tasks panel (above the Open filters).

Supports inline tokens (order independent):
	•	#category → sets the task category
	•	@project → assigns the task to an existing project (matched by name)
	•	^due:tomorrow or ^due:YYYY-MM-DD → sets due date

Behaviour:
	•	Creates the task for the selected day in the current profile
	•	Strips recognised control tokens from the saved title
	•	Clears after save and keeps focus for rapid entry

Example:
	•	Call plumber #DREAM @Admin ^due:tomorrow

🕒 Snooze / Reschedule (startDate only)
Adds “Snooze” actions that adjust startDate (not due date), available in:

Single-task controls
	•	Tomorrow
	•	Next business day (skips Sat/Sun)
	•	Next week (+7 days)
	•	Pick date…

Bulk toolbar
	•	Same Snooze options apply to multiple selected tasks at once

🔒 Recurrence-safe behaviour
	•	Snoozing recurring tasks applies to the current occurrence only
	•	No series rewrite, no duplication, and tasks continue on their normal repeat cycle

Why This Matters

PR10 dramatically reduces friction in day-to-day usage:
	•	Adding tasks becomes instant
	•	Rescheduling is effortless
	•	Workflows stay clean without opening modals constantly

It sets up the next phase (PR11) to focus on project progress visibility rather than mechanics.

📊 PR11 — Project Progress Bars (Day view)

Summary

PR11 introduces per-project progress tracking in the Day view, giving immediate visibility into how work is distributed and progressing across projects.

Alongside the existing overall day progress bar, you can now see completion status for each project (and unassigned tasks), making it easier to spot bottlenecks and understand where your effort is going.

⸻

✨ What’s Included

📂 Project Progress (Today)
A new section appears directly beneath the main Day progress bar:
	•	One row per project that has tasks counted for the selected day
	•	Includes an Unassigned row for tasks without a project
	•	Displays:
	•	Project name
	•	Done / Total count
	•	Compact progress bar

Rows update instantly when:
	•	Tasks are marked done or reopened
	•	The selected day changes
	•	Profiles change
	•	Archived visibility toggles

⸻

🗃 Archived Behaviour
	•	Archived projects are hidden by default
	•	When Show archived is enabled:
	•	Archived project rows appear
	•	Archived styling and badge are applied

⸻

🧠 Why This Matters

PR11 shifts the tracker from just showing what’s done today to showing where progress is happening.

It enables:
	•	Better daily planning
	•	Faster identification of stalled projects
	•	A foundation for future reporting and analytics

⸻

🔒 Scope
	•	Day view only
	•	No database or API changes
	•	Built on the same task visibility logic as the main Day progress bar

____

📅 Latest Update — Tracker UX & Matrix Layout (March 2026)

✅ What we shipped

🎨 Visual refresh (Tracker)
	•	Switched tracker UI from dark theme to light “retro cream” palette
	•	Introduced softer card surfaces for better readability
	•	Improved contrast hierarchy for:
	•	Headers
	•	Filters
	•	Table rows
	•	Overall goal: closer visual alignment to DREAM matrix clarity

🧭 Navigation & structure
	•	Added Tracker / Reporting toggle in header
	•	Cleaner top control bar with:
	•	View switch (Day / Week / Month)
	•	Date navigation
	•	Search
	•	Archive toggle
	•	Quick add task

📊 Matrix-style task tables
	•	Reworked Open and Done into true matrix tables:
	•	Consistent column headers
	•	Fixed row density
	•	Clear task metadata (Project, Category, Dates, Status)

🧷 Sticky header bug fix
Root issue:
Sticky <th> cells were offset to viewport (top-[73px]) causing first row to render underneath header.

Fix implemented:
	•	Each table now lives inside its own scroll container
(relative max-h-[520px] overflow-y-auto)
	•	Sticky headers now use top-0 so they anchor to the card, not the page

Result:
✔ First row fully visible
✔ Header remains sticky
✔ No spacer hacks
✔ No changes to sorting/filtering/data logic

🗂 Reporting direction set
	•	Confirmed approach: Reporting as a dedicated page
	•	Concept aligned with DREAM matrix summary philosophy

⸻

🧠 Product direction confirmed

The tracker is evolving toward a personal operational matrix, not just a to-do list.

Core principles going forward:
	1.	Matrix clarity over card clutter
	2.	Fast scanning (status + time + ownership)
	3.	Reporting as a first-class view
	4.	Minimal cognitive load

⸻

🚧 Next priorities

1️⃣ Reporting page (MVP)

Goal: DREAM-style summary layer

Planned components:
	•	Period selector (Day / Week / Month / Custom)
	•	KPI strip:
	•	Tasks created
	•	Tasks completed
	•	Completion rate
	•	Overdue count
	•	Category / Project breakdown
	•	Trend chart (completion over time)

⸻

2️⃣ Drag & drop ordering (DB persisted)

Allow manual prioritisation of tasks

Scope:
	•	Drag within filtered list
	•	Persist orderIndex per profile
	•	No effect on sort modes (date / status)

⸻

3️⃣ Table usability enhancements
	•	Column visibility toggles
	•	Density modes (Comfortable / Compact)
	•	Keyboard navigation

⸻

4️⃣ Header & branding polish
	•	Final logo placement refinement
	•	Optional subtle elevation on sticky header
	•	Responsive tightening for smaller screens

⸻

5️⃣ Data & intelligence layer (future)
	•	Task aging indicators
	•	Smart “focus” suggestions
	•	Reporting export (CSV / PDF)

⸻

🗺 Longer-term vision

The tracker becomes:

A lightweight personal command centre
sitting philosophically between a task manager and a DREAM matrix.

It should answer instantly:
	•	What needs attention?
	•	What’s slipping?
	•	Where is time going?

____

🧭 PR12 — Profile Ordering (DB Persisted)

Profiles can now be manually reordered via drag and drop on the home screen.
The order is persisted in the database so it remains consistent across sessions.

Highlights
	•	Added order field to Profile model
	•	Drag and drop UI on home screen
	•	Bulk reorder endpoint (/api/profiles/reorder)
	•	Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure

Result

Profiles now behave like a configurable workspace list rather than a fixed menu.

⸻

🧩 PR13 — Tracker Matrix Layout & Reporting Mode

The tracker UI was refactored to adopt a DREAM-style matrix layout with tasks as the primary surface.

Key changes
	•	Introduced sticky command bar with unified controls
	•	Moved analytics and summaries to a dedicated Reporting page
	•	Reduced vertical density and card clutter
	•	Converted task lists into structured matrix tables
	•	Added collapsible advanced add section

UX impact

The tracker now loads directly into a working state with tasks visible immediately, reducing cognitive load and aligning the experience with a matrix workflow model.

⸻

🗂 PR14 — Drag & Drop Task Ordering

Tasks can now be manually reordered within the Open list, with order persisted per profile.

Implementation
	•	Added orderIndex to Task model
	•	Migration backfilled deterministic ordering
	•	New reorder endpoint (/tasks/reorder)
	•	Native drag and drop interaction
	•	Optimistic updates with persistence on drop

Behaviour
	•	Manual ordering applies when Sort = Manual
	•	Other sort modes remain unaffected
	•	Order persists across refresh and restarts

⸻

⚙️ Default Sort Update

Manual sorting is now the default tracker sort mode, ensuring tasks open in the user-defined priority order immediately.

🧭 PR17 — Overview Page (All Profiles Dashboard)

Summary

A new Overview page has been introduced to provide a high-level view of all profiles and their active tasks in one place. This allows the user to see workload across all areas (e.g. Simon, Sales, DREAM, Personal) without switching between profiles.

The Overview page acts as a command centre for the system.

Key Features
	•	Displays all profiles on one screen
	•	Tasks are grouped by Project
	•	Tasks without a project are grouped under Unassigned
	•	Each profile shows summary counts:
	•	Open
	•	Done
	•	Overdue
	•	Quick Add task bar available directly from Overview
	•	Ability to:
	•	Collapse/expand each profile
	•	Jump directly into a profile’s Tracker via Open tracker
	•	“Show more” used to keep long lists compact


_____


## Overview Dashboard

The Overview page provides a matrix-style dashboard showing all profiles and their active tasks in one place.

- "Show more" to expand long task lists

### Global filters (Overview)
Filters apply across all profiles:
- All open — active tasks (not future upcoming)
- Today — tasks due or starting today
- Overdue — tasks past due
- Upcoming — future tasks

Profiles remain visible even if no tasks match the selected filter.

---

## Task Grouping Rules

Tasks are grouped using the following logic:

1. Recurring — all recurring tasks
2. Unassigned — tasks with no project
3. Projects — tasks assigned to a project (manual order)

"Recurring" and "Unassigned" are virtual groups and are not stored as projects in the database.

---

## Navigation

Home screen:
- Select a profile to open its Tracker
- Open the Overview dashboard
- Add and reorder profiles

Overview:
- High-level dashboard across all profiles

Tracker:
- Detailed task management (Day / Week / Month)

Reporting:
- Summary and reporting view (per profile)

---

## Installed App

TaskManager can be installed as a local web app and opened from the dock like a desktop app.

The app uses a web app manifest with:
- Standalone display mode
- Start URL: `/`
- Scope: `/`

This allows Home, Overview, Tracker, and Reporting pages to function inside the installed app without browser UI.
